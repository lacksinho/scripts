# ðŸ“œ Scripts and Utilities  

A collection of **useful scripts** in multiple languages (Python, R, Bash, etc.) for data analysis, automation, visualization, and general tasks.  

Note:

No real data is used in any examples, models, or visualizations.

Graphs and datasets are synthetic, generated programmatically for demonstration.

Scripts include mock data generators for testing and example workflows.
